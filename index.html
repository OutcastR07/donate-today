                <h3>Food</h3>
                <p>Food will be bought and supplied to all the people in the villages from the donation money. Our first
                    priority is the north of our country at the moment, since the people of these areas are unable to
                    buy food for themselves cause of the heavy loss from flood.</p>

                <h3>Medicine</h3>
                <p>Emergency medicines will be supplied to all the people in need. Specially to the people who are
                    unable to buy their own food for financial crisis. </p>

                <h3>Shelter</h3>
                <p>Houses will be built for the homeless with the donation money. It is really a nightmare when people
                    do not have shelter for them to sleep at night. So, building shelter for the families in need are
                    our priority.</p>
